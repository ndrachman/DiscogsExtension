# Discogs Ships From Filter

A Chrome extension that adds country filtering to your Discogs wantlist. While Discogs provides country filtering in the main marketplace, this functionality is missing from the "Items I Want" view. This extension fixes that by adding the same filtering capability to your wantlist.

## Features

- Adds a "Ships From" country filter dropdown to your "Items I Want" list in the Discogs marketplace
- Shows all available shipping countries from your current wantlist items
- Instantly filters items based on seller location
- Matches Discogs' native design
- No data collection or external services
